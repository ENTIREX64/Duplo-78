# Duplo-78
### Introducing Duplo-78, my custom voice assistant

## Features
### This voice assistant has various features, ranging from fairly simple website changes, to API calls.
#### General Features:
- Recognizes voice commands and stores them as transcripts.
- Responds to the user via Text To Speech.
- Displays the percieved transcripts in the console
#### Specific Features: 
- Changes the background of the webpage upon command.
- Opens desired websites.
- Plays jazzy music.
- Contains an in-built calculator.
- Provides the date and time.
- Gives interesting facts.
- Cracks (somewhat) funny jokes.
- Gives real-time weather information of any city.
- Updates you with the latest news headlines.

## Running this project
- This project can only be run online, as downloading the files and running the `index.html` will not give a smooth experience, especially with the API features.
- You can find the link [here](https://entirex64.github.io/Duplo-78/).
